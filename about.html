        <div class="features-column-text">
            I am an Analyst/Programmer/Software Developer with many years experience using a technology now known generically
            as Multi-Value. Originally called Pick, this is a niche noSQL multi-value database and development product, of which I have
            used a number of flavours, first working on Pick/Reality platforms, I moved onto Universe (Multi-Value on Unix) before
            finally working with OpenInsight(Multi-Value on Windows).<br><br>

            Using Multi-Value, I have provided solutions predominantly for the Finance Industry. I created a system that calculates 
            Capital Gains Tax liability for Clients Portfolio of Stocks and Shares. I played a major role creating a Portfolio Performance
            Monitoring system. In recent years, I wrote and maintained a back-end Trading Platform for Fund Supermarkets with interfaces
            to the web and straight-through processing to the Fund Managers.<br><br>

            Despite its capabilities, Multi-Value has always been a niche technology, never enjoying the popularity of other development 
            technologies. More recently, Multi-Value has also become regarded as legacy technology in many circles.<br><br>

            During my time with Multi-Value, it has always been my ambition to cross-train onto newer technologies permanently. I have 
            had exposure to Java and also the TIBCO business process management products, namely iProcessor & Business Works. Working 
            with these technologies was extremely enjoyable. Sadly, business requirements of the organisations I worked for required 
            my time was spent working with Multi-Value.<br><br>

            When I parted ways with my previous employer, I decided that now was the time to break permanently from Multi-Value and 
            retrain onto different technologies. The Software Development Bootcamp provided by JustIT gave me the opportunity to fulfil 
            that ambition. Not only did the 12 week programme provide excellent teaching of <b>HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python & MySQL</b>, 
            but also the jumping board to expand my knowledge beyond the course syllabus. Hence, I am currently learning Web-App and Gulp 
            for HTML/CSS/Javascript projects and Flask and SQLAlchemy for Full Stack Projects. As an experienced software developer, I am 
            well versed of the capabilities of IT Systems. In essence, I am looking to see what I can do with these technologies that 
            I used to do in Multi-Value.<br><br>

            With the course completed, I am now looking for my first opportunity as a Junior Full Stack Developer to put into practice 
            what I have learnt in a professional setting. I want to expand my newly acquired skills, learning from my future colleagues 
            to build upon solid foundations for my continued personal development and progression. Whilst I am confident that I can provide 
            robust fit for purpose solutions with the technologies I have learnt, I will be looking for more experienced eyes who can advise 
            how I can do better.<br><br>

            There may be those who might be puzzled as to why an experienced Software Developer would want to take a more Junior position. 
            Some may even think it is a step backwards. I for one do not hold this view. Rather, I regard taking a Junior Developer role 
            as an investment is improving upon my newly acquired and gain the solid grounding that is essential to progressing to more 
            senior positions. <br><br>

            Despite this I still retain my extensive experience of the software development life-cycle acquired from my previous roles. 
            Regardless of the programming language, gathering user requirements, supporting System And User Acceptance testing, releasing 
            changes to Production and supporting post-release warranty remains largely the same in principle.<br><br>

            I have always had a passion for writing software, but what I have learnt in the last three months has boosted that passion 
            and my love of this endeavour. Fuelled by that passion and enthusiasm, I move forward in the search for my next role, the 
            first as a Full Stack Developer.<br><br>
